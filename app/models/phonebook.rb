=begin
  Phonebooks speeddial mus be unique for each user, but we have to remember that
  admin's phonebooks are global, so setting unique on user_id and speeddial is not 
  an option - speeddial has to be unique for phonebooks user and for admin.
  If phonebook is beeing updated(it has id) we should exclude information about it. 
  In case phonebooks owner is admin phonebooks must be globay unique, hence there is 
  no other condition, except for excluding phonebook itself(if it's already created) 
  But note that if phonebooks is associated with calling card it's user_id is set to 0, 
  0 is admin's id, so we have to exclude cards that are associated with callingcards. 
  And make sure that they are unique for that certain calling card
